1
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,240
I talk to lots of people who come here

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,050
looking for the Silicon Valley experience

3
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,410
They arrive with one suit case in hand

4
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,980
when they head south on the 101.

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,500
Hoping to see it this place they've heard about

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,240
and its freeways, and its office parks

7
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,960
and its strip malls, and

8
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,330
it looks like every place they've ever been

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,890
end up wondering where are they come,

10
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,020
why did they come here,

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,530
what was that brought them

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,530
Code itself is the underlying thing that makes computers work

13
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,110
Why is it important to the world, it's because

14
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,200
it's the blood of the organism, that's our culture now,

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,200
it makes everything go

16
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,680
Technology has become a God of our society now

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,680
I mean I think that its--people stand in awe of it

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,370
and stand in awe of the people that make it

19
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,620
There's a sense that software is a kind of new frontier

20
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,680
it's you know it's the old gold rush metaphor

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,680
the California gold rush all over again

22
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:30,030
It's the kind of Hollywood of the Twenties.

23
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,670
This very small set of people is really defining

24
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,830
what our world's gonna be like

25
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,350
I mean you know the computer becoming ubiquitous

26
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,480
and the way we interact with the world

27
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,290
more and more mediated through the computer

28
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,980
is this very small group of people

29
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,990
defining what that world's gonna be like.

30
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,480
Netscape !

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,760
everywhere !

32
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,740
team !

33
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,540
fight !

34
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,480
Less than three years ago

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,430
a small team of engineers at Netscape Communications

36
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,420
created software that made surfing the Internet easy

37
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,570
and in the process change the face of computing

38
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,990
On this day however, the company is in big trouble

39
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,370
driven to the ground by its rival and software colossus Microsoft

40
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,400
Only a radical strategy will help save it.

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,890
"Let's hear a loud Mozilla !"

42
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,080
Mozilla ! Mozilla ! Mozilla !

43
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,780
Netscape is giving away its source code

44
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,100
to programmers outside the company

45
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,240
The source code is the secret formula for browsing the web

46
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,240
The code is named Mozilla and if widely adapted

47
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,030
it will make Netscape's code the Internet standard

48
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,330
drawing users to its other products

49
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,320
and restoring the company's sagging fortunes.

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,410
Our story focuses on team of engineers

51
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,400
who will come together in this building

52
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,400
Over the course of the next year

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,580
they will turn their lives inside-out to create Mozilla

54
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,600
and battle a giant competitor to save their company

55
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,700
and shape the future of computing.

56
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,010
Right now we have a problem with the work looks like it can't possibly be done

57
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,240
for the date we announced

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,130
so were just trying to

59
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,080
drill down on how doomed we are

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,510
and sometimes the only way to do that is

61
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,830
to get everybody in the room and stare each other in the eyes.

62
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,740
We said were giving you Netscape Communicator on 3/31

63
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,640
so if were not giving them Netscape Communicator on 3/31

64
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,640
we need a way to address that.

65
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:44,890
The goal is to get Mozilla to developpers by March 31th

66
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,890
a few shorts weeks from now

67
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,080
it is one of the most ambitious schedules in the company history.

68
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,990
- It's a joke

69
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,950
- I think we have been very exclusive

70
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,400
Michael Toy one of Netscape's first employees

71
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,450
heads the team that will prepare Mozilla for public release.

72
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,670
We're probably doomed, we're probably gonna fail

73
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,050
Microsoft is probably gonna squish us like bug anyway

74
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,160
but just cause were doomed doesn't mean

75
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,170
you know we cant get up in the morning and do work

76
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,080
All rise

77
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,800
the honorable Michael Toy presiding.

78
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,150
I'm pretty flip with my kids about what I do.

79
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,320
What do you do at work dad? Oh I don't know I sit in meetings

80
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,730
and feel depressed and I read e-mail.

81
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,480
Oh oh you got me !

82
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,960
They think my office is the greatest place in the world though

83
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,700
It's like "Oh were going to your office ?"

84
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,340
"Oh yeah yippie I love going to you office !"

85
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:46,330
They play with the guns and there is free soda

86
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,330
and there is the giant balls

87
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,550
basically I worked at Disneyland as far as they're concerned.

88
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,030
I talk about marathon versus sprint.

89
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,210
The hard part is to run with significant intensity the all way

90
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,580
knowing that if you ever start walking

91
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,400
you're not going to make it and just keep the end in sight

92
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
and know that there's this urgency.

93
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,840
Jim Roskind an expert on software security

94
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,420
is brought in to enforce rigorous standards of engineering precision.

95
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,260
Imagine if you had a project

96
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,210
where you felt doom was imminent

97
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,890
all the different players wondering

98
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,460
are they pushed beyond their level

99
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,460
can they think of way of running faster,

100
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,480
can anyone help them ?

101
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,370
So there's lot of tension

102
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,060
and anxiety over making the schedule.

103
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,550
Jamie Zawinski, free source code evangelist

104
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,700
will enlist outside developers to Netscape's cause.

105
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,190
The free source thing is trying to change the rules, right.

106
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:39,560
There are people who have the free software religion,

107
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,950
the one thing they have in common is they're all hackers

108
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,370
they're all like writing code

109
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,800
so you hoping to tap in to all of those smart people

110
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,680
and get something from them, you know, so that everyone benefits..

111
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,020
I talk about 2 millions and 2 half millions lines of code

112
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,020
and everyone of them has to be gone over

113
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,280
carefully and in some cases twice.

114
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,220
With hundreds of engineers converging on Mozilla,

115
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,220
with new code to enable its release,

116
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,850
Tara Hernandez make sure

117
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,950
that their changes do not crash Mozilla

118
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,870
and brings everyones work to a hold.

119
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,260
This is how we keep track

120
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,800
of all the changes that are going in.

121
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,190
Green is good.

122
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,520
Lot of changes going on right here,

123
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,340
and wham, the build all died.

124
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,630
Ok, alright, bye.

125
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,360
We're doomed.

126
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,960
Some of the worst crashes are reserved for Scott Collins

127
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,940
a veteran code writer who stands by

128
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,970
for late night troubleshooting.

129
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,170
I've been here for about

130
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,170
I don't know, 60 hours or so.

131
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,480
Writing software is different from

132
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,480
selling real estate.

133
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,600
Selling real estate you sell the people

134
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,000
the people sleep at night.

135
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,810
When they go to sleep you have to stop selling real estate

136
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,280
Computers never sleep.

137
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,170
You can see my cube is decked out a little bit better than

138
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,170
all the people's.

139
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,340
I have a nice couch

140
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,600
little mattress under there I can sleep in

141
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,160
artwork from my children

142
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,750
I have control the light switches.

143
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,740
This is what I'd like to get if my wife truly love me

144
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,440
she'd let me have one.

145
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,640
Life is good.

146
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,480
Ok

147
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,440
Bug count.

148
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,000
Alright, there are a ton of bugs on here that

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,120
people just aren't doing anything about.

150
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,570
To give away its code

151
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,740
Netscape engineers must make thousands of bug fixes

152
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,980
Often minute changes that will allow the code

153
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,300
to be used by outside developpers.

154
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,880
Jeff Weinstein has, one, two,

155
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,270
three, four, five, six,

156
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,760
seven, eight, nine, ten,

157
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,710
eleven, twelve, thirteen.

158
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,850
One bug hidden in the mass of code

159
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,440
can stop everyone else's work

160
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,020
and can threaten the ship date.

161
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,280
I need someone to page Jeff Weinstein

162
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,240
and get him to call 2024.

163
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,010
Even a team of twenty people building a car

164
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,140
it's easy to step back fourty feet and look and go

165
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,140
"Hold it, that guy has not putting on the wheel"

166
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,540
You have fourty programmers working

167
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,160
they all come to you with code, a gigantic morass

168
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,680
of little details piled up on a disc

169
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,030
usually can even see the pieces whether they're doing it correctly

170
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,550
You have to assemble it into a whole

171
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,040
and then see if the whole works

172
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,320
and then you're not even sure of who gave you the bad bits.

173
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,850
That would be bad. Let's go downstairs, come on!

174
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,500
You're talking about a recipe.

175
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,020
Who gave you the bad flour.

176
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,400
Someone went out to grind flour,

177
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,720
and they had to all be exactly

178
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,660
the right size chunks of flour.

179
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,960
Someone else made chocolate chips,

180
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
they all had to be exactly the right size chunks.

181
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,840
You can't figure it out until you put it all together

182
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,880
you hand it out, and people go.

183
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,340
"I don't like the way this tastes"

184
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,400
And now you have to wonder,

185
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,160
with all these details coming together

186
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,840
which was the problem

187
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,840
who's causing the problem, how can you fix it?

188
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,400
You've got to ship on a certain time.

189
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
And now you have all this people,

190
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,990
you have the clock ticking and it gets pretty intense.

191
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,700
Since Nescape began

192
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,520
the amount of code making up Mozilla

193
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,520
has increased by a factor of 30.

194
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,360
The job of programming and debugging it

195
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,410
rests upon a precarious balance of science and art.

196
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,790
They talk about what they do as if

197
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,890
it was a kind of alchemy, a kind of wizardry.

198
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,980
It does remind me of athletics in that way.

199
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,040
You know why is someone a good baseball hitter?

200
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,210
Often the hitters themselves can't really explain it.

201
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,000
And often the best software people

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,600
cannot themselves understand why they're so good at it.

203
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,040
But I think make a great programmer is being raised techie.

204
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,050
My particular team at Netscape, I think we all grew up techie

205
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,120
We all grew up with computers around us somewhere,

206
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,140
so that we were exposed to them before we became

207
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,710
adults, if any of us are really adults

208
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,710
Jim is the most grownup of us.

209
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,280
A lot of my childhood from roughly age 6 to age 17

210
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,460
was around here.

211
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,710
Life was just a nightmare, this is a very, very scary place

212
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,610
So to school wasn't too bad.

213
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,870
Ah, but it meant it

214
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,700
you'd get to work on puzzles and problems.

215
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,320
All of the puzzling is math,

216
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,880
and that puzzling is the exact same feeling

217
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,540
the exact same problem that you go through

218
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,640
when you're programming.

219
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,800
When I was young it'd be building with erector sets and Lego

220
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,100
now the structures that you build are in software.

221
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,330
My mom is a first class geek too.

222
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,710
And so I have a unique experience of being able to talk

223
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,960
shop with my mom, cuz' she's a director of

224
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,400
really important stuff at Sun.

225
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,880
At Netscape one of the code words for is the average person

226
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,110
who is going to be able to use this software is,

227
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,110
"Well can my mom use it?"

228
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,510
Yeah, my mom can use it.

229
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,510
My mom can write optimizing compilers.

230
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,680
By the time I was 12 years old I was making 50 bucks an hour

231
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,950
programming computers.

232
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,620
People say what should I be should I grow up to be a...

233
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,090
I say computer programmer.

234
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,740
The thing about that makes it a youth culture

235
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,230
is one's capacity to throw one's entire life on the line

236
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,490
with these firms

237
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,820
Entire life commitment meaning

238
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,860
24-7-365 work commitment.

239
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,680
It's throwing yourself into a thing

240
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,840
where you don't know if that job

241
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,120
is going to be around soon.

242
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,010
There's no stability in here.

243
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,450
So the very kind of weird irony

244
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,610
is that very people who are inventing the future

245
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,670
can't see their own future.

246
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,740
This is a monk-life existence

247
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,930
there are very few women in these societies.

248
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,060
These are male societies,

249
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,760
they are secret societies,

250
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,590
they function very much like the Masons

251
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,800
or some street gang.

252
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,850
Evil!

253
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,560
Evil ! Evil !

254
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,320
Evil man !

255
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,150
Why am I an evil man ?

256
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,800
Did you or did you not hear a man saying
Why am I an evil man ?

257
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,860
Did you or did you not hear a man saying

258
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,860
if you have a source leaving one bug, you will be

259
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,640
in here at 1:30.

260
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,040
I thought it was 2:30

261
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,800
Now you're evil and stupid.

262
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,440
(laughs)

263
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,000
You now that, I'm actually just in a different time zone.

264
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,160
I thought stupidity was an excuse though.

265
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,920
A lot of people at Netscape don't get out much

266
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,120
because they're at work all the time but

267
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,450
most of people's social interaction I would expect is

268
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,450
revolves around work just because

269
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,920
so many people spend so much of their time at work.

270
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,400
Hi Chris, it's Tara

271
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,080
um, how much do you love me?

272
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,040
Good.

273
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,680
What do you know about way the threading stuff

274
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,040
that falls into Javascript stuff and Java makes it feed?

275
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,920
All we have left to hold on to, really

276
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,080
is the work place, I mean it is the modern village.

277
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,310
People get to know your history

278
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,350
they shrug about your bad jokes.

279
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,710
There's a kind of familiarity that

280
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:58,380
and continuity that we don't have elsewhere.

281
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,480
Paul

282
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,600
we're going to go out in a while and get something to eat

283
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,410
and do stupid things. You're interested?

284
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,850
Sure. Sure. Right.

285
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,080
Ok, the purpose of this meeting is not to beat up people

286
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,230
the purpose of this meeting is to make sure that

287
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,660
as a company we are incredibly focused on

288
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,400
getting the bug count to 0

289
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,760
we've been moderately focused up until now

290
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,920
we need to be deadly focused

291
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,640
from here on in.

292
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,540
Ok Jeff Weinstein

293
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,540
is he in this room?

294
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,830
He's not in this room.

295
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,230
Did not check-in this weekend, true or false?

296
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,800
He did not check-in this weekend

297
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,920
He did not answer his mail

298
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,480
and he hasn't answered his phone yet either.

299
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,840
His locator shows he's with the rest of the colonists

300
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,840
(laughs)

301
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,520
The old saying is that trying to manage programmers

302
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,520
is like trying to herd cats.

303
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,520
You know you want them to be cats

304
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,290
if you like cats, I mean 'cause you want what's unique about

305
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,680
that creature

306
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,220
But they really don't all like to go in the same direction.

307
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,920
In less than four years

308
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,420
Netscape has grown from a handful of people

309
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,720
to over 200

310
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,880
and sometimes, locating a programmer

311
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,360
become yet another obstacle

312
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,220
for the browser team to overcome.

313
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,360
I'd say he's not in there.

314
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,710
That would be my guess, straight out.

315
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,210
He's not there.

316
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,040
When's the last time he was in here?

317
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,160
This afternoon.

318
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,760
Ok

319
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,900
Tara and I are ready to take a hit out on him.

320
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,700
and well if ya see him when he comes back tell him to

321
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,720
panic and run around and we're like

322
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,670
doomed on Mac right now with this thing.

323
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,760
Doomed !
doomed on Mac right now with this thing.

324
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:27,770
Doomed !

325
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,320
The person working on Mac is like waiting for data right ?

326
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,490
You should go around to every person in the company saying, "Doomed!"

327
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,470
Netscape predicament has much to do with this man

328
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,160
Bill Gates, whose company, Microsoft

329
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
has made him the richest, and arguably

330
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
the most powerful man in the world.

331
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,710
Allright if we can have order we'd like to begin.

332
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,420
Viewing Netscape's browser

333
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,790
as a potential threat to his computing empire

334
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,450
Gates has moved swiftly,

335
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,180
making his own browser free

336
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,960
and Netscape claims,

337
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,680
also engaging an unfair business practices

338
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
to take away its customers.

339
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,180
But we need to explore today

340
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,680
whether you and your company

341
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,200
have crossed the line

342
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,870
or on the other hand

343
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,480
whether this is just the carping of disgruntled rivals.

344
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,050
Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale

345
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,420
argues his company's case before the Senate.

346
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,520
And certainly nobody here on this panel is

347
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,890
a greater admirer of Mr. Gates

348
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,300
or his company than I am.

349
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,120
But we do ask that Microsoft

350
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,080
be held accountable

351
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,010
for some of their actions.

352
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,370
Actions that intimidate PC OEM manufacturers

353
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,400
to use their products and exclusionary practises

354
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,330
that prevent them from using my products.

355
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,330
Not all companies succeed.

356
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,540
Some fail to embrace change.

357
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:42,760
This is the way technology in the free market works.

358
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,520
The software industry's success

359
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,400
has not been driven by government regulation

360
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,680
but by freedom and the basic human desire

361
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,360
to learn, to innovate and to excel.

362
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,510
Meanwhile thousand of miles away

363
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,500
Netscape programmers continue working around the clock

364
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,640
in a race to meet Mozilla's release date.

365
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,600
These guys they tend to work very consistently,

366
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,860
so they'll just keep working until it's done and they won't stop.

367
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,050
They don't need food, they don't need sleep,

368
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,010
they don't need anything

369
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,130
OK, so they take pay, but...

370
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,050
A while ago some people from Harvard came and said

371
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:19,050
"Well how do you develop software, we're writing a book" and I

372
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,650
and I talked about all the things I thought

373
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,000
were really important and they were just

374
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,200
it felt to me like they were shaking their heads going,

375
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,240
Oh, gee, he doesn't know about Principle 7

376
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,040
and oh, he doesn't know about Principle 22

377
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,570
and in some ways they're right... I really haven't got a clue.

378
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,370
Right I really like to err on the side of

379
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,610
every day we wake up in the morning and say

380
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:37,720
based on what I know today

381
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,760
what's the best way to get to where we all want to go?

382
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,060
I personally or me and you three of us

383
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,830
do no have time to read all two millions of source code

384
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,240
to see that, there are no remaining problems.

385
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,560
We're going over here

386
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,880
zeroing in on Jeff Weinstein.

387
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,020
With March 31st only days away

388
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,790
the team can't proceed until Jeff Weinstein

389
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,890
an expert on some of Netscapes most arcane code

390
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,690
finds time to complete the bug fixes on his list.

391
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:07,840
How are you doing ?
finds time to complete the bug fixes on his list.

392
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,600
How are you doing ?

393
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,370
OK

394
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,600
Alright well

395
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,280
you are officially the most doomed

396
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,280
individual in the company sir

397
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,480
this one I can close, stay with this one

398
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,480
yeah bunch of these

399
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,110
Urn hopefully I'll get most of it done tonight

400
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,040
His goal he was just going to stay all night

401
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,440
and he was going to get it all done.

402
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,660
The good news is actually I think by about

403
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,110
I'm not sure if it was 9 or 11 o'clock at night

404
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,110
he actually was completely done.

405
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,200
Yeah !

406
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,680
Reaching a critical milestone

407
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,720
is cause for celebration.

408
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,100
And one bug left

409
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,070
and it's a really really hard one

410
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,280
Don't make me kill you, close 4330.

411
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,920
I will close 4330.

412
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,630
Bug count is small

413
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,000
there are some bugs that are not currently closed

414
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,480
but most of them are like piddly little annoying things that

415
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,580
Some of its stuck !

416
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,760
All praise the uh the mighty ones that created tremendous pile of

417
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:16,200
people working really hard this week to do the impossible.

418
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,880
There is this magic phrase that Michael Toy invented

419
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,880
which is "Zarro Boogs", hum

420
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,670
which is it's not quite perfect

421
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,000
but it's perfect enough

422
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,550
as zero bugs / "zarro boogs".

423
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,450
Do you have a spare monitor upstairs?

424
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,220
Yes I do have a spare monitor.

425
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,140
This is the first big test

426
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,680
Will an outsider actually be able to make mozilla work?

427
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,090
If not Netscape stands a good chance of missing its March 31st deadline

428
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,820
I thought it's gonna be huge thing,

429
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,520
I thought it's gonna be like a hundred,

430
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,740
two hundred people here like all and rows

431
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,530
like with soviet style.

432
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,530
We are near that organized

433
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,380
Looks like it's all here, here we go!

434
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,410
Wow! All good, it's pretty simple how stuff is built.

435
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,170
It's just there's set of scripts that are set up

436
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,240
to say exactly what to compile and then

437
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,250
they all get globbed together into Mozilla hopefully.

438
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,710
- Here it is
- Yeah

439
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,720
If you get it to work, then it means anybody can get it to work.

440
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,510
That's true.

441
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:28,390
(WILD CHEERING clapping laughter)

442
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,350
- And look It has an about face!
- ...Look it's so cute...

443
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,120
- Oh, that was pretty

444
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,590
- Yeah it's...
- No, I don't think it's working.

445
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:44,480
- Well go to the..
- Well
- Oh...
- Big crash...

446
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
- Hell shot the foot...

447
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,090
It's actually going really well.

448
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,510
I didn't think we'd actually get somebody

449
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,620
to build this quickly.

450
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,600
We had to do one small adjustment and it worked!

451
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,720
With the source almost ready to ship,

452
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,760
Netscape must explain the significance

453
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,350
of Mozilla to the press.

454
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,470
Basically what we wanna do is we wanna give them a little bit of the history

455
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,860
and then we wanna go into the what's actually going to happen tomorrow.

456
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,360
The other important take away then too from this

457
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:20,090
is that this is a really exciting cool thing.

458
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:24,800
- Good afternoon, Forrester
- Hi Stan Dolberg and uh Eric Brown please.

459
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,050
- One second.

460
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,750
- You've reached voicemail for Stan Dolberg -- I'll transfer you now

461
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,910
- Good afternoon, Forrester.

462
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,240
- Hi this is Maggie Young.

463
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,060
I'm calling from Netscape and I have scheduled

464
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,670
conference call with Stan Dolberg and Eric Brown

465
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,710
and I just got Stan's voicemail.

466
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,950
Netscape hopes the press will greet Mozilla with the same enthusiasm

467
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,350
it had for the company in its early days.

468
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:53,380
At eleven AM this morning, Netscape's stock went public and Wall Street went bonkers.

469
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:56,130
Initially offer had a price of 38 $ a share,

470
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,400
Netscape shut up to 72 within minutes...

471
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,860
The stock is bid up at extraordinary levels

472
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,040
in the first couple of really days and weeks

473
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,520
of its introduction.

474
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,290
It is the biggest initial public offering

475
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:16,150
in basically the Wall Street history.

476
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,720
- Good afternoon, Forrester

477
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,320
- Hi this is Josh Walker.

478
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,080
Today less than three years after its record breaking IPO however,

479
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,030
Netscape's story generates a different response.

480
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,130
- Hi there
- Yup

481
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,770
- As you now tomorrow is March 31st

482
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,810
- So that means hum, source code will be made

483
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,810
available to the developer community.

484
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,820
And we thought we would just

485
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,750
catch you up to speed and walk you through

486
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,060
that and see if you had some questions.

487
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,590
- Either I'm braindead or it takes lot of effort to communicate

488
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,500
and so I'm concerned that while you all know

489
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,390
what it means, I'm not confident

490
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:56,840
that it's coming across to the press.

491
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,640
- Right, I think those are good points.

492
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,340
By opening up the source code, we basically extend our developer community

493
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,280
from those folks that are inside of Netscape

494
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,820
to hundreds and thousands of developers

495
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,870
outside of Netscape

496
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,730
so it's no longer Netscape versus Microsoft.

497
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,120
It's Netscape and all of the Netscape,

498
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,880
you know, virtual community.

499
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,310
- I think there is a belief that Netscape

500
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,030
doesn't have a position to continue

501
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,860
to compete with Microsoft

502
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,520
in the browser front and that

503
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,840
in essence you've given up on the browser position.

504
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,500
This was a lot more smooth than I had originally anticipated.

505
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,230
Really.

506
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,720
I'm still waiting for the major bump in the road

507
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,340
that's gonna happen some time between now

508
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,560
and tomorrow afternoon.

509
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,140
In software development there is

510
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,580
always a bump in the road.

511
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,580
We just want to hear the Apple story

512
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,940
They just can't quite get themselves comfortable

513
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,980
with the patent grant or with

514
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,340
whatever we tried to do to fix it for them.

515
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,430
So the last thing back out of their lawyer was

516
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,260
"gee, oh I don't know that we get enough protection."

517
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,090
Mozilla has a small piece of code from Apple that has not been cleared for public license.

518
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,020
- Ok.
- We have to escalate.

519
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,460
- Hi this is Mark Andreeson,

520
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,440
I called a few minutes ago, and left message

521
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,660
we're trying to get - the problem is I can't get phone

522
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,920
there's no one at the Apple switchboard

523
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
so I'm having a hard time getting phone numbers for people.

524
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,860
Awesome.

525
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,260
Hold on, 6 2 0.

526
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,300
In order to ship Mozilla the next morning,

527
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,110
Scott Collins is called in

528
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,370
to replace Apple's code with his own invention.

529
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,880
And theoretically we believe this is possible.

530
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,340
It's my last bug. When I complete this bug,

531
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,900
I will be allowed to rest.

532
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,760
So I stayed up until about 5:40,

533
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,730
this morning writing this replacement class.

534
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,370
It made my life a living hell.

535
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,390
I got it basically running, it's all running,

536
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,290
it's all really good, and thank heavens

537
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,940
we got permission from Apple

538
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,300
to ship the regular source.

539
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,230
It's my understanding that Jamie

540
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,720
is gonna be the person that's gonna be pushing

541
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,390
the bits up to the website at around 10:00,

542
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,660
is that correct?

543
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,750
OK.

544
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,130
And we're gonna be staging some different

545
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,580
photo opportunities for the press at that time,

546
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,150
there will be television cameras you know news crews

547
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,870
- Couldn't we just like hire actors to do this for us?

548
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:30,990
- ...just tell them they get to be on TV come on..
- We're not gonna mandate it..

549
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,760
- You're on TV right now.
- We've been on TV for two months.

550
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,240
- I don't think anyone is gonna come.

551
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,320
One way to learn to run marathon

552
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,610
is put a person out 26 miles into the desert,

553
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,970
and say there's this bomb on your back

554
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,750
that's gonna go off in a certain length of time

555
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,190
if you don't get into the town.

556
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,220
Well, that'll motivate you to get in

557
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,310
but there is a certain chance that you'll be blown up.

558
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,830
- You know what time it is?
- Yeah it's five to ten.

559
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,110
- Aah! Going to be late. Hurry up!

560
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,940
Welcome everybody to the conference call.

561
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,630
Thanks for joining us this morning.

562
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,630
Today Netscape announced that

563
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,470
the first developer release of its Communicator 5.0

564
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,910
source code is available for download

565
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,120
from the Mozilla dot org website.

566
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,090
- You know where Tara is?

567
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,850
- Second floor?

568
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,480
- It's first floor, way on the other side.

569
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,170
And then today on the end of March,

570
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,440
as we announced, we are pushing the code

571
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,600
out to the Web as they say,

572
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,050
and we are delighted to be part of it

573
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:33,790
and we're very excited to see what happens.

574
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,250
The good news is the marathoner is now

575
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,120
coming into town with that bomb on his back

576
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,370
and it looks like he's gonna make it.

577
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,670
- This is the moment of truth!

578
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,560
They don't have theoretical framework

579
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,630
to write software, they're just writing it.

580
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,960
It's just like hitting the baseball.

581
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,910
If their code gets a home run,

582
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,490
nobody's asking questions.

583
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,920
Well, this doesn't make sense,

584
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,450
or why do you that, why does it work.

585
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:05,810
Nobody cares why it works.

586
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:20,850
- Wait this is bad.
- What's that?

587
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:25,730
- Well it's not connecting to...
- The machine that controls

588
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,280
the FTP push is, like, not answering.

589
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,540
- Is it loaded?
- It's "blast" not "blash".

590
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,480
- Oh
- Yeah maybe they're...

591
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,620
- Mac's there. UNIX is there. Windows is there.
- We're done!

592
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:44,520
- It's on!
- Yeah!

593
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,250
- Since Jamie is here, I am told that means

594
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,580
that we have now pushed the source out on the Net.

595
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,400
Is that correct ?

596
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,020
- Actually, we decided not to.

597
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,900
We thought it was a stupid idea.

598
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,950
- That's our story and were sticking to it.

599
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,530
For a moment, everyone at Netscape

600
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,810
takes a breather.

601
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,830
- I think it's gonna work out.

602
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,660
In the first hour of its release,

603
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,530
the source code is downloaded thousands of times

604
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,710
but the number of downloads is no guarantee

605
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:41,660
that Netscape will receive enough valuable contributions

606
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,130
to help the company to reverse its slide.

607
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,400
He's known as Pavlov to me. He's Pavlov at

608
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,490
Pavlov.net, on IRC he's Pavlov or Pav or

609
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,380
um, Pav Sleeping, or Pav Tired Up Too Late.

610
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,550
And um without him I think we'd be months behind.

611
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,430
Netscape's notoriety draws code writers

612
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,800
from around the world willing to work on Mozilla without pay.

613
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,500
One such contributor comes from rural Georgia.

614
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,200
I've been amazed over the last two or three years,

615
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,420
when especially his mother would come tell me

616
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,680
"Well, so and so called" from maybe New York

617
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,100
and they were coming to Atlanta

618
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,990
and they wanted to talk to Stuart or see him,

619
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,740
and they were gonna go down and have lunch.

620
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,920
"Well", I'd say "Who is this person from New York?"

621
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,670
And the all of a sudden "Well, he's been working

622
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,050
with Stuart on some programming issues

623
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:34,270
for a year or so and he wanted to come down

624
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:37,740
and meet. "Well, did you tell him you're only sixteen?"

625
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,080
I had no idea. Um, and that's great,

626
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,040
that's a wonderful thing because

627
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,610
he's contributing. It doesn't matter that he's young.

628
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,010
The place we call the cave. We just shut the door

629
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:55,150
and this is where he does whatever he does.

630
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,820
It is flabbergasting to think that your child

631
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,780
has done something for this worldwide company

632
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,110
instead of his homework.

633
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,320
I went and looked back at the older code

634
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,210
and I was really frightened by how

635
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,100
incredibly messy and just awful the code looked.

636
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,980
It would have taken you know

637
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,270
years to try and figure out what it was doing.

638
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:21,260
So we basically did it from scratch.

639
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,380
Pretty much I'm providing the code that makes

640
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,590
the browser show everything faster

641
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,200
and more efficiently than it used to.

642
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,010
His keyboarding is almost just like talking.

643
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,120
It's just um, an expression.

644
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,630
He can express himself that way

645
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,830
and it's just totally unconscious, almost.

646
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,880
Just a part of how he communicates.

647
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,630
In the past, free code contributions

648
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,220
helped build the Internet.

649
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,150
How commercial enterprise would benefit

650
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,740
from free code remains a big question.

651
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,660
Well, it's certainly my hope that

652
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,760
the enormous amount of new people

653
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,120
that no one company could afford

654
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,940
to have working on any product,

655
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,660
now contributing to the Netscape Navigator

656
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,570
Communicator will make a significant difference

657
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,280
in the improvement of the product.

658
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,720
How that works against any competitor,

659
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,250
remains to be seen.

660
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,770
-Good morning
-Good morning, Thank you.

661
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,060
David Readerman an analyst for San Francisco Investment Bank,

662
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,560
closely monitors Netscape's radical plan

663
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,320
for investors eager to participate

664
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,050
in the Internet stock boom.

665
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,430
The market is really kind of a voting machine,

666
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,210
it's voting yes I believe that vision statement.

667
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,500
Yes I believe that's gonna result in products sales.

668
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,710
Yes that's going to drive earnings up, and

669
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,710
you know stocks should traded accordingly.

670
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,250
The financial benefits to Netscape of

671
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,950
giving away its source code are hard to measure.

672
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,390
I understand why Netscape's trying to do it.

673
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:02,270
They still have to show me that

674
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,690
behind the vision and the slideware,

675
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:08,460
there's a real sustainable business model

676
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:11,130
that can deliver earnings hum,

677
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,560
and so I'm in show-me mode for Netscape.

678
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,930
Now, my job will be three times

679
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,880
as hard as it was yesterday and it was already ten times harder than it needed to be.

680
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,060
Right? Did I just work really hard to ship

681
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,130
the company jewels out of the building and

682
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,200
it's just gonna end in us dying

683
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,530
and rolling in poison and misery.

684
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,460
The day after this stuff goes out,

685
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,590
you really don't get to let up.

686
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,150
There is then the sort of day in day out,

687
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:45,090
go to work turn on the computer, code, code code.

688
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,940
- Thanks Tara.

689
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,540
- Tara?

690
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,950
- Yeah what's your doctor say Tara?

691
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:55,820
- Uh, my doctor says interestingly enough

692
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,820
that I work too much

693
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,260
and uh, that if I went to work today after

694
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,470
my appointment he would personally kill me.

695
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:07,760
I have an agreement with myself

696
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,030
that by the time I'm 35, I'm either going

697
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,850
to be high school teacher or bartender,

698
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:13,950
but something, anything other than a

699
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,080
in a position in the hightech industry,

700
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,120
otherwise I'll probably die by the time I'm 40.

701
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,460
Uh, now that I'm an old guy

702
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,590
I've kind of been round the block

703
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:32,850
couple times and you can go from realizing,

704
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,490
"This just never stops, does it?"

705
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,220
And that being really depressing

706
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,920
because you feel like it "I'm on, I'm on".

707
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,680
I said I was never going to be on the treadmill

708
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,610
and here I am. I'm on the treadmill.

709
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,850
I'm going to be running like this forever.

710
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,980
Because they're good at software,

711
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,940
they need to keep pace.

712
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,060
And as a result, keeping pace means

713
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,900
to shut a lot of other things out.

714
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,600
They just don't have time to read,

715
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,140
time to hear about the world.

716
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,090
They don't have much time for their families.

717
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,830
Um, but when you're in situation where

718
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,810
you really have a lot of work to do

719
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,090
and no time to do it,

720
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,040
you know, you pick what you want.

721
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,770
Some people pick wanting to have a family.

722
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,020
Some people pick wanting to

723
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,400
get some software done.

724
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,800
Christopher was born right after I started at Netscape,

725
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,350
and I basically missed the first

726
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,710
two years of his life because of the intensity.

727
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,530
I'd work 'til about 7 or 8 o'clock,

728
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,280
come home, eat dinner,

729
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,520
put the kids to bed, and then go back to work,

730
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,390
or work from home, until 2 or 3

731
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,580
in the morning, and was like the Dad zombie.

732
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,160
He would call and say, I'm on my way home

733
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,030
and then it would be 2 or 3 hours and

734
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,300
you know, the romantic dinner candles

735
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,100
had burned down

736
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,690
and I was thinking he was dead

737
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,020
by the side of the road so,

738
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,150
you know if 24 hours goes by

739
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,110
and I don't hear from him,

740
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,450
that I pretty much know where to find him.

741
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:53,090
I live in Michigan. And I commute.

742
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,530
So it's quite a long commute,

743
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:57,230
I don't make it every day.

744
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,500
I only make it about every two weeks or so.

745
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,480
But um, It is quite a time change.

746
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,290
Here it's something like 12:01

747
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,320
in the morning, and there it's 1954.

748
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,430
The motivation from moving back here is

749
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:21,130
I wanted to get into a community,

750
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:25,210
put roots down, and you know, feel settled.

751
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:28,900
And I...Life is just different out there,

752
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,970
it really is. I mean here people like worked

753
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:36,000
car factory or whatever... thirty years and out.

754
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:42,010
We spent, like, 45 minutes talking about all his

755
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,900
like, his whole story, from job, to job, to job, to job.

756
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,210
I thought it was pretty cool.

757
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:53,330
He had like ten or something, jobs.

758
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,770
He seemed to do it a lot during particularly peak

759
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,490
stressful times, like, you know, baby due

760
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,450
in two months, I'm changing jobs now, dear.

761
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,210
I like when everything is changing.

762
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:05,960
That makes it's exciting. That's why I do it.

763
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,120
It's something to be in the storm,

764
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,410
right in the middle of it and seeing everything

765
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,390
new happening and putting it all together.

766
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,190
It's really exciting.

767
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:18,080
It's almost addictive. I wouldn't want to leave it,

768
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,060
that's for sure.

769
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,190
At times, it's a clear sacrifice

770
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,520
of elements of your personal life.

771
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,210
I have to work very hard but I have

772
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,760
the chance of being rewarded for my efforts.

773
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,090
This disadvantage, my life's moving on.

774
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,930
I don't have any children yet,

775
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,380
you realize there's a certain amount of

776
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,160
my life that I'm sacrificing I'm going to look back

777
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,030
and a portion of this life is gone.

778
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,280
In the U.S., we have at least several million people

779
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,060
directly making a living from software.

780
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,020
And it's the fastest growing group of

781
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,440
people in the economy.

782
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,250
And it's certainly in aggregate,

783
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,830
the highest paying field of its size.

784
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,640
I mean yeah, you've got baseball,

785
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,950
you've got Hollywood.

786
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,940
But you know when you really

787
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,150
think of a group that has millions of people in it,

788
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,850
these are the highest wages anybody

789
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,330
has ever seen in the United States.

790
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,730
The opportunity to win big

791
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,790
for code writers is very real.

792
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:23,650
In fact, that if you will jackpot

793
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:26,230
opportunity is reflected here on a

794
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,790
Wall Street trading desk.

795
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:31,080
And I find that a lot of the engineers

796
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,410
and managers from Silicon Valley

797
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,510
are very attuned to what goes on

798
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,460
on these trading floors daily.

799
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,090
By one account, 64 millionaires are created daily

800
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,700
in Sillicon Valley where any technology worker

801
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,860
can fix me rich over night.

802
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,020
You join a company and they give you

803
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,320
some stock options which basically says,

804
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,610
rather than just giving you stock,

805
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,260
they give the right to buy the stock

806
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,870
in the future at the current price.

807
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:03,010
You might get stock in the order of

808
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,360
maybe a year's salary or

809
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,800
two years salary typically, worth of options.

810
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,920
In some of these real booming companies

811
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,970
out there on the Internet, the potential for

812
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,780
becoming a millionaire or doing very well,

813
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,800
is very, very high.

814
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,340
The people who were very,

815
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,660
very early, they call them "Mozillionaires".

816
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,220
Stock options are a con.

817
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,090
Um, it's a carrot they dangle, it's like,

818
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,450
oh well, you know if you'll give up

819
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,500
your one and only youth,

820
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,080
maybe someday you'll make money, right...

821
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,470
it's um, I've known so many people

822
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,740
who have gambled on start-up lottery

823
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,970
and got nothing.

824
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,940
You know it's just like lottery ticket, it's stupid tax.

825
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,960
Um, I happened to win that particular lottery.

826
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,890
From the day Microsoft announced

827
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,330
its aggressive commitment to the Internet, however,

828
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,030
Netscape stock has been in steady decline,

829
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,610
and throughout most of 1998 Netscape

830
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:54,360
options are essentially worthless.

831
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,530
A year and a half ago,

832
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,630
half of our revenue came from browser sales.

833
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,160
Today none of it does, so well,

834
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,260
Any business person out there knows

835
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,340
that that's a huge challenge.

836
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,490
I mean let me take your number one selling product

837
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,770
away from you and you replace that

838
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,020
within period of 12 months or so.

839
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,670
Not many people want to do that.

840
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,470
Even though the company sells other Internet products,

841
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,370
the marketplace views Netscape as a browser company

842
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,640
in a losing battle with Microsoft.

843
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:22,540
- Greg this is Jim Barksdale with Netscape Communications, how are you ?

844
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,980
It's clear that Netscape doesn't have

845
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,730
enough pieces to threaten Microsoft.

846
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,660
I don't think that Netscape long term

847
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,320
can survive as an independent company.

848
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,280
While Mozilla tries to recapture the early,

849
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,610
glory days of the company,

850
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,050
integrating code from the outside means

851
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,490
more work for everyone on the browser team.

852
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,910
- Apparently I must have done it backwards

853
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,630
from what you told me, or I don't know what

854
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,630
- Ok, this is too fast

855
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,890
- We want to take the old free tree

856
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,620
and use it as subsection,

857
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,430
and we want to build this interesting tree around this.

858
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,280
- No that's not want we want to do

859
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,640
NS Private fix me at the top, right ?

860
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,050
- A project file for this or project file for that,

861
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,500
it can't be a project file for both.

862
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,940
We don't have a plan for doing both.

863
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,100
So right now I have some files that have

864
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,200
to come from here for Java in single directory,

865
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,330
and some files that have to come from here

866
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,300
in the same directory, the same directory.

867
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:16,300
Tell me how I do that?

868
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,390
That's the problem.

869
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,720
The browser division which costs the company

870
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,240
almost 30 million dollars a year to operate

871
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,650
and contributes few revenues to the company

872
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:31,040
is reorganized in the fall for the second time

873
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,170
in less than year.

874
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,760
Do we have all the answers: no.

875
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,460
We're going to try and learn what we can from

876
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,200
seeing the people who've done this well...

877
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,200
When I joined a start-up, I knew that 19 out of 20 fail.

878
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,880
When an employee comes

879
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,350
to work at Netscape today,

880
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,890
he doesn't have the perception

881
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,470
that there's a 19 out of 20 chance

882
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:48,520
that this job is not gonna be in place

883
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,990
1 to 5 years from now.

884
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,460
If you live here, it is the ubiquitous conversation

885
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,310
"Do you believe that Microsoft

886
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,210
has used either a) illegal

887
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,390
or just unfair methods

888
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:04,630
to take market share from Netscape?"

889
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,870
And if the heart and soul of this industry is

890
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:12,070
opportunity, is egalitarianism, Microsoft having

891
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,130
achieved its market share

892
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,820
on anything other than the backs of its code

893
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,170
really riles every body up.

894
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:25,270
Justice department has charged Microsoft

895
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,650
with engaging an anti-competitive and exclusionary practises

896
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:34,470
designed to maintain its monopoly in personal computer operating systems

897
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:39,460
and attempting to extend that monopoly to internet browser software.

898
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,830
Regardless of its case against Microsoft,

899
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:41,870
Netscape has become a victim of its increasing size
Regardless of its case against Microsoft,

900
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,660
Netscape has become a victim of its increasing size

901
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,570
and the growing complexities of its code,

902
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,160
the company struggles to maintain the vitality

903
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,160
it enjoyed as a start-up.

904
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,650
When a company gets to be above a certain size,

905
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,370
it's a process, it's a mechanism for making money.

906
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:00,130
And innovation is like one possible way of doing that,

907
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,980
but it's a risky way.

908
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:02,670
So companies, big companies don't do that.

909
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:06,570
Um, Microsoft actually doesn't do very much, they buy companies.

910
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,960
They wait until someone has done something interesting and then they acquire them,

911
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,400
and then they milk it for all it's worth.

912
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:15,070
I don't mean to pick on Microsoft because lots of companies do that, it's just the normal way of doing business.

913
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,310
We're on out way to the Flint Center now.

914
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,230
We're going to have an all-hands meeting.

915
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,310
Jim Barksdale has moved up the all hands meeting by roughly about a week.

916
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:36,010
We just announce quarterly results and now this major change in direction.

917
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:43,000
Well, in case you haven't read the newspaper,

918
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:50,980
we have, as of 1:30 this morning,

919
00:41:52,980 --> 00:42:02,290
concluded negotiations and agreed to sell our company to AOL of Dulles, Virginia.

920
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:10,270
I can't imagine that day when they announced the merger,

921
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:13,370
that they weren't like "Oh, I don't believe this".

922
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:16,310
You know, sort of a nightmare scenario.

923
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,770
Although, you know, the worst one would have been

924
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,770
Microsoft's buying us, I guess, you know.

925
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,890
Then they would have, you know you would've seen like

926
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,240
his this flow of cars out of Netscape

927
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,390
Six months ago they were insulting AOL's technology,

928
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,090
you know, it was the service for idiots.

929
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,970
Congratulations skippy, you've got mail!

930
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:37,770
Netscape is not unusual in the way they felt about AOL in Silicon Valley.

931
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,970
I mean, it' very clear that nobody

932
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,470
had any respect for the company.

933
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,950
One of them at Netscape

934
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,060
called Steve Case a soap salesman

935
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,060
because he used to work at Proctor and Gamble.

936
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,320
The soap salesman bought them.

937
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,170
The quote that came out of this article was

938
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,600
"Netscape: (similar lines of) lived fast,

939
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,570
died young, and left a tired corpse".

940
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:03,470
And I don't know if they agree with that.

941
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,870
I don't think Netscape's done yet.

942
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:07,110
They bought us because they like us,

943
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:07,990
they like what we do,

944
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,640
and they don't want to disturb that formula;

945
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,870
so their plan is to not damage us in any way.

946
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,160
There had been alot of, uh,

947
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,940
a lot of speculation out on the net,

948
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,390
you know, in the free software community, like

949
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:20,820
oh well this is it, you know,

950
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:21,670
it's all over now

951
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:23,380
"AOL's just gonna screw everything up".

952
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,160
So I wrote this thing

953
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,730
that I put on the Mozilla.org site

954
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:27,810
that just laid out the worst case scenario,

955
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:28,770
like, well okay,

956
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,460
even if everything goes wrong

957
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,610
it's still not as bad as you're saying it is.

958
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,360
Because the nature of what Netscape did

959
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,990
meant that the code belongs to the community now.

960
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,660
Few days later I got email from Steve Case,

961
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,580
saying, um, we thing that you're doing is great thing and

962
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,690
and it's part of the reason we bought the company

963
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,390
we plan to keep it going that way, so

964
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:52,190
um, as far as Mozilla.org and Netscape and AOL's contribution

965
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,750
to the open-source movement goes,

966
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:57,270
he says, it's gonna continue...

967
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:01,710
The merger with AOL creates a windfall for shareholders

968
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:05,560
that will give Netscape employees the chance to cash out and move on,

969
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,920
causing speculation in the national media

970
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,760
about AOL's ability to retain Netscape's key people.

971
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,260
And already I hear, you know,

972
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,240
that AOL people come at Netscape and say,

973
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,570
yeah this is the AOL way.

974
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:19,670
It's not gonna work at Netscape.

975
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:22,900
It's gonna be the Netscape way with help from AOL!

976
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,650
I suspect some of them will leave.

977
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:26,800
You know, they don't want to be part of AOL.

978
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,110
Some people just like the start-up mentality.

979
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:32,000
And those that want to be part of a juggernaut

980
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,920
are going to stay and be part of the juggernaut.

981
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,010
I've been at Netscape for 3 and a half years and it feels like forever.

982
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,190
And AOL's focus and Netscape's growing focus has been marketing and advertising,

983
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,230
all that stuff, and that's

984
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,540
not nearly as interesting

985
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,800
to someone who's sort of a techno-fetishist.

986
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,290
I'm switching jobs and selling my house,

987
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,000
I'm moving, switching towns...

988
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:00,100
That's life for start-up land.

989
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,150
I'm still young and stupid as I like to put it,

990
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,050
so I can get away with that stuff like that.

991
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:10,120
Year and a half ago, so Tara comes to me she says

992
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,570
"I want to be a manager so bad, that I can taste it".

993
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:17,560
So we finally said alright, you get to be a manager.

994
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,550
And like within a week she said

995
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,750
"Why did you ever let me do this?"

996
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:30,100
And Tara has turned out to be like one of Netscape's greatest managers.

997
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,200
So here is to Tara, release team manager.

998
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:37,550
Tara leaves Netscape for an e-commerce start-up,

999
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:40,640
missing out on a big jump in the value of her stock options

1000
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,950
in hopes for a bigger pay out at her new company.

1001
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:57,700
Regardless of how AOL runs the Netscape business,

1002
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,980
it's not Netscape anymore - that part's over.

1003
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,800
And you know, that's really sad

1004
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,230
I wish Netscape could have gone it on their own.

1005
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:08,500
Frustrated by what he perceives as a lack of commitment to open-source development,

1006
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,600
Jamie quits Netscape one year to the day he helped to give away Mozilla.

1007
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:16,200
The movie Hackers I think is just a great movie.

1008
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,000
I wish our lives were like that,

1009
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,150
I wish we were roller skating around in spandex and fighting bad guys,

1010
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:25,650
but you know it's not it's sitting in a room and typing all day.

1011
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:31,740
This is what I was trying to escape, this life.

1012
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,940
I knew I did not want to live here.

1013
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,750
I've been out here now about four of five years.

1014
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:43,500
This is a nice place. This is escape from the jungle.

1015
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:53,070
Jim Roskind is promoted to Netscape's highest engineering rank.

1016
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,940
Last night I was here at four in the morning,

1017
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:59,200
and this isn't even in the middle of a critical push.

1018
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,840
But it's almost like an addiction, an adrenaline rush,

1019
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,900
a going for perfection, a pushing.

1020
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,490
And then as you see the results, you get the feedback to push harder.

1021
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,990
You know I really shouldn't comment on this

1022
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:16,380
since I'm just as foolish as everyone else is

1023
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,070
but I'll just go ahead and do it while admitting that I'm foolish,

1024
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:20,900
there's just a tremendous quest for material wealth here.

1025
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,200
It's like the goldrush all over again.

1026
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,400
And this is gonna be the playhouse.

1027
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,210
And then this will be like a front porch I think a little flowers and stuff.

1028
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:30,670
So it will be like a cute little house.

1029
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:34,800
I went to Netscape because its main purpose was to generate cash,

1030
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,500
based on this internet thing.

1031
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,580
It's like what we're gonna do, we're gonna get rich.

1032
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,880
It just took a heavy toll on our marriage,

1033
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,500
and, if it wasn't for God's grace,

1034
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,040
we wouldn't have made it.

1035
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,440
"Why would I use god gives"

1036
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,800
Micheal burned out.

1037
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:57,030
Michel, came to a place, in his own life where he said the cost is too great,

1038
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:59,190
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

1039
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:02,480
If people are - would look at this and say oh

1040
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,980
hey this is a cool thing, I'm gonna start a start-up

1041
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,750
and get rich quick

1042
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,360
I would just have to say

1043
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,740
you need to count the costs

1044
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:13,370
because you can't ever retrieve the time that's lost.

1045
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,270
Michael Toy

1046
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,100
Netscape employee number 6

1047
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,300
achieved his goal of financial independance

1048
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,950
and retired from Netscape shortly after Mozilla's release.

1049
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,330
In the Valley,

1050
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:33,690
if you've stayed someplace longer than about three years

1051
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:35,220
people wonder what's going on?

1052
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,220
Why can't you get another job, what's wrong with you?

1053
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,220
If you're a programmer, you pretty much change jobs

1054
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,220
about every two years or so.

1055
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,220
It's like ants,

1056
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:43,880
worker ants.

1057
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,880
They send out a group out to do something.

1058
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,660
As that group approaches

1059
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:48,970
the task that they're gonna do

1060
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:50,970
some ants leave, more ants come on

1061
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,020
By the time it gets to the target

1062
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,500
it could be a totally different set of ants

1063
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,520
I think as we distribute the set of work that we're doing

1064
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,520
and more and more, in the Information Age

1065
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:02,620
it'll be more like that.

1066
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:07,110
Scott Collins continues to commute to Netscape from Michigan.

1067
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,820
There's lot of pressure right now

1068
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,820
to complete our product on time.

1069
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,480
Um, sort of wade in with

1070
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:21,430
the ridiculous acrobatics the stock is doing.

1071
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,430
We were a 20$ company

1072
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:26,820
and as of this moment our stock is at 172$.

1073
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,880
So it's hard to be depressed about the amount of work

1074
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,560
you have to do when

1075
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:33,560
every other cube holds a millionnaire.

1076
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,910
When the deal with AOL closes in the Spring of 1999

1077
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:43,130
the value of Netscape's stock more than doubled since the merger's announcement.

1078
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:45,820
Netscape married right.

1079
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,260
They hitched their fortunes to AOL

1080
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,260
when the transaction was announced,

1081
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:54,840
the implied valuation was about 4.2 billion

1082
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,840
when transaction was completed,

1083
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:00,170
the transaction was valued at 10 billion.

1084
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:04,340
So in effect about 5.5 or 6 billion dollars

1085
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,640
of net worth was created

1086
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,460
so I think it was the very clever deal-making

1087
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,890
of Netscape management that kept them in the game

1088
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:18,560
much longer and Netscape's shareholders benefited quite considerably.

1089
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,730
Mo-

1090
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:21,870
-zill-

1091
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:22,950
-la

1092
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,290
lives !

1093
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:26,440
While many executives sold their stock

1094
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,040
during Netscape's final year

1095
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,620
Barksdale bought more

1096
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,890
and after the merger he swapped his shares

1097
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:35,000
for more than half a billion dollars of AOL stock.

1098
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,900
Another young man comes west

1099
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,210
to seek his fortune on technology's new frontier.

1100
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,900
I'm a little bit nervous going into this interview,

1101
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,310
cause I'm not entirely sure what to expect.

1102
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:52,180
It's a long way away

1103
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,060
Three thousand miles

1104
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:57,270
is a long way for your child to be

1105
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:02,360
But this is a place where there's a lot going on that

1106
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,410
he's very interested in and I think

1107
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:06,410
has some talents in this area.

1108
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:09,470
And I really think that this may be

1109
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:13,170
kind of home for him as far as

1110
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,170
being able to work with people

1111
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:17,510
that he can actually talk to.

1112
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:24,950
- Pavlov!

1113
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:29,390
- What I want to know is,

1114
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:30,870
what you want to do

1115
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,640
I mean, what your goals are in the next couple of years?

1116
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,040
- My goal right now

1117
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,700
is that I want to see the UNIX version faster than the Windows version.

1118
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,070
Once you pull that off,

1119
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,260
then, you know, we'll see.

1120
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:44,280
But that is my goal.

1121
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:47,860
Pavlov is hired by Netscape.

1122
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,150
He postpones going to college.

1123
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:55,060
Taking part in what one investor has called the largest

1124
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,730
legal creation of wealth in the history of the planet,

1125
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:00,590
David Readerman moves to a new investment bank.

1126
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,580
Here's the data center,

1127
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:08,170
a lot of cable, a lot of fiber.

1128
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:12,270
These can be sort of, you know, internet connections

1129
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,790
they can be our trading lines, our phone lines.

1130
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:17,780
You know we're lying the infrastructure

1131
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:21,040
to basically build a major merchant bank.

1132
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:24,520
Our view is that the internet changes everything

1133
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:26,840
and we're going to finance the companies

1134
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,330
that want to be the agents of that change.

1135
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,040
Look at this intersection,

1136
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,320
we've got a bank here,

1137
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,980
in two years you know this may not be here,

1138
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:45,330
why not bank online?

1139
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,150
Gap's website

1140
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:52,590
is one of the most successful commerce websites

1141
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:54,590
on the market.

1142
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:59,030
I don't even know why Gap's renovating this store?

1143
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:01,600
Why aren't they investing more in their website?

1144
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:06,480
I don't know what this intersection may look two years from now.

1145
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:11,180
When I started people didn't know what HTML was,

1146
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,880
what the World Wide Web was, and then all of a sudden

1147
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,880
the power of the Internet that had been there

1148
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,130
for years is available to everybody

1149
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:20,330
in an easy way, Point & click, the universal language.

1150
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:23,770
It's like in Fantasia when Mickey is standing over the

1151
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,400
the book that's open on the mountain,

1152
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,510
and he's looking in to see what to do

1153
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:28,510
and he does something. And he doesn't really know what he does

1154
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,890
but it makes something happen.

1155
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:32,260
And of course this thing gets out of control and keeps going.

1156
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,990
You don't know why it works, you don't know how it works,

1157
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:35,790
you just push a button and it works.

1158
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:37,810
We're at the beginning of an industry and

1159
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:39,810
who knows where that industry's gonna go?

1160
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:41,890
This could all turn into television again.

1161
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:44,580
It could be controlled by a small number of

1162
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,180
companies who decide what we see and hear.

1163
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,180
And there's a lot of precedent for that.

1164
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:53,510
I'm just laying down the tracks

1165
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:55,510
and there were these trains zooming by me,

1166
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:57,440
and there's no way I'd want to say it's a

1167
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,440
bad thing to have these trains fly by.

1168
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,860
I could be a horrible legacy.

1169
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,230
If it ended up being a legacy of,

1170
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:06,600
you know, Netscape and the Internet,

1171
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,070
that we could all like,

1172
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,680
do what we're doing only under

1173
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,360
much more intense pressure and

1174
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,720
much faster.

1175
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,450
Everything has to change faster,

1176
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:20,150
obviously, you know, look at Netscape.

1177
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:22,150
It was born and died.

1178
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,950
I don't want to use the word "died", they wouldn't like that word.

1179
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:26,300
But basically it was born and overtaken

1180
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,760
within four years.

1181
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,050
That's pretty fast, I think.

1182
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,830
They must think it's very fast.

1183
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,830
Near the end of 1999,

1184
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,510
the public still awaits Netscape's

1185
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:37,510
first open source browser,

1186
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:39,980
more than a year after Mozilla was released.

1187
00:54:40,270 --> 00:54:42,120
The judge and the justice department

1188
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:44,440
end a trust trial rules that Microsoft

1189
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:46,770
is a monopoly, it stiffles innovation.

1190
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,570
AOL begins the millenium

1191
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:50,620
with a new even larger aquisition,

1192
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,430
and investors continue buying technology stocks,

1193
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:56,220
which trade with increasing volatility.

1194
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,280
Still as the Internet finds its way

1195
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,060
into every corner of daily life,

1196
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,180
so to fix melegions of programmers

1197
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,380
and their code, working fast

1198
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:07,380
and late into the night.
